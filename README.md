# 🐍 Snake

**A modern browser-based Snake game built with Flask, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.**

## 🎯 Overview
Snake is a fully reimagined version of the classic Snake game.  
It’s faster, cleaner, and designed for both desktop and mobile play.

This was my third project. I wanted to take something simple and work through the full logic from scratch.  
My first version was a basic black-and-white single-session game.  
The addition of an SQLite database adds a small sense of community between me and my friends as we compete for high scores.
